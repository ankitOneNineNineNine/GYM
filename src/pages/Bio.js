                            I have been lifting weights since I was 22 years old. So I know what it is to start late.
                            I have an experience of lifting weights in GYMs with minimal equipments. So I understand your problem if your GYM
                            doesn't have fancy new machines.

                            I have trained in weight lifting, martial arts like Boxing and Muay Thai. Hence I pretty much know what most normal people
                            want with their physique.
                            I dont give you crappy bullshit training regimes to waste your time in GYMs for hours and I dont give you crappy diet plans which is not sustainable
                            ever in your life.
